1. Python: 

High level
Functional programming language
Object oriented programming language
Interpreted language 
    - not compiled, but executed line by line
    - no need to compile before running

Easy to learn
  Syntax - simple english like syntax
  libraries - large number of libraries available
  community - large community support

python : less no lines of code compared to other languages
        
    - Windows based applications
    - web applications
    - data science
    - machine learning (rich libraries
    - deep learning (rich libraries)
    - automation
    - scitpting
    - game development

    cross platform - runs on windows, linux, mac, etc

    
print and input users
store data in variables
use operators to manipulate data
keywords and identifiers in python
dynamic typing - not required to declare data types initially, automatically assigned by python



<!-- C Program -->
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}

<!-- java -->
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}

<!-- Compile, Executing -->

Python is an interpreted language, which means you can run Python code directly without needing to compile it first. This allows for quick testing and iteration.
